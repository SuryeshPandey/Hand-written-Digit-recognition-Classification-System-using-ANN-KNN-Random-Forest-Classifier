# Handwritten Digit Image Classification using ANN, KNN, Random Forest Classifier

This project explores various machine learning models to classify handwritten digit images using the MNIST dataset. 
It focuses on implementing and comparing K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Random Forest classifiers.

# ðŸ“‹ Overview

Handwritten digit recognition is a multi-class classification problem in computer vision and machine learning, with applications like postal mail sorting and form digitization. This project demonstrates the implementation and evaluation of three ML models on the MNIST dataset.
