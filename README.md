# Hand-written-Digit-recognition-Classification-System-using-ANN-KNN-Random-Forest-Classifier


1. Introduc,on
Handwri)en digit recogni/on is a mul/-class classifica/on problem in computer vision and machine learning, with applica/ons ranging from postal mail sor/ng to form digi/za/on. This project uses K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Ar/ficial Neural Network (ANN), and Random Forest (RF) classifiers to achieve reliable handwri)en digit classifica/on on the MNIST dataset, a widely used benchmark for image classifica/on.
2. Objec,ves
1. Model Training: Train and evaluate three machine learning models—KNN, ANN and
Random Forest—on the MNIST dataset.
2. Predic,on Interface: Create a user-friendly system for classifying handwri)en digits
